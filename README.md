Background:-
    The National Earthquake Information Center (NEIC) determines the location and size of all significant earthquakes that occur worldwide and disseminates this information immediately to national and international agencies, scientists, critical facilities, and the general public. The NEIC compiles and provides to scientists and to the public an extensive seismic database that serves as a foundation for scientific research through the operation of modern digital national and global seismograph networks and cooperative international agreements. The NEIC is the national data center and archive for earthquake information.
    The dataset includes a record of the date, time, location, depth, magnitude and source of every earthquake with reported magnitude 5.5 or higher. Our aim is to formulate a machine learning model that predicts the earthquake prone areas using time series magnitude data. 
Dataset:- we are taking database from kaggle.
